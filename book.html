                    Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by <span class="author-names">Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter.</span> 
                    It advocates the importance of financial literacy (financial education), 
                    financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, 
                    real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence 
                    (financial IQ) to improve one's business and financial aptitude. 
                    Robert Kiyosaki followed the book with Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant and Rich Dad's Guide to Investing. 
                    He has at least a dozen books published.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, 
                    ostensibly based on Kiyosaki's life.The titular "rich dad" is his friend's father who accumulated 
                    wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, while the "poor dad" is claimed 
                    to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his life but never obtained financial security.

                <p>Lets know about criticism.</p>
            </header>

            <p>John T. Reed, a critic of Robert Kiyosaki, says, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad contains much wrong advice, 
                much bad advice, some dangerous advice, and virtually no good advice." 
                He also states, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad is one of the dumbest financial advice books I have ever read. 
                It contains many factual errors and numerous extremely unlikely of events that supposedly occurred.
                Kiyosaki provided a rebuttal to some of Reed's statements.

                <p>Lets know about the publishing success.</p>
            </header>

            <p>
                The book was originally self-published in 1997 before being picked up commercially 
                to become a New York Times bestseller. It has since sold over 32 million copies and become 
                a household name.In his audiobook Choose to be Rich, Kiyosaki said that every publisher turned him down,
                and Barnes & Noble refused to stock the book initially. 
                He places his focus upon talk shows and radio show appearances, of which The Oprah Winfrey Show 
                had the biggest influence on book sales.
